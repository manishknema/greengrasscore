# Setting Up ARM-based Ubuntu 18.04 for AWS Greengrass Core
I wanted to see for one project how [AWS Greengrass Core V2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/greengrass/v2/developerguide/what-is-iot-greengrass.html) is beneficial for local processing and Since most of the IoT Edge devices are based on the ARM architecture and very constraint typically 8-12 GB RAM and 10-100 GB Disk with/without GPU/NPU. I want to test out features of Greengrass before going full blown deployment in actual devices. 

## Why QEMU
This is required to create VM of ARM Linux (Ubuntu xx.xx aarch64) in Host which is  x86_64 based. Following is the answer from `GPT 40`

Creating ARM-based guest VMs on x86-64 hosts can be done using various virtualization tools that support emulation. Here are some popular options:

1. **QEMU (Quick EMUlator)**:

### Recommended Approach: QEMU

Given the goal of creating ARM-based Ubuntu 18.04 aarch64 guest VMs on an x86-64 host, QEMU is the most versatile and widely used tool. Hereâ€™s a brief guide to setting up an ARM VM with QEMU on an x86-64 host:

 **Install QEMU**:
   - On **Ubuntu**:
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get install qemu-system-arm
     ```
   - On **Windows** using Chocolatey:
     ```powershell
     choco install qemu
     ```


I have previously tried to create QEMU Guest Ubuntu 18.04 image with bridge Networking in my Host Ubuntu 22.04 using netplan and then with NetworkManager I faced lot of problem in setting it up

I have use [ChatGPT 40](https://chatgpt.com/) to get instruction but those instructions were not working. When I setup bridge my whole wifi or ethernet stops working 

Same happend when I use Host as Windows 11 machine with bridge networking for which `chatgpt` gave instruction to install openvpn as virtual adapter and bridge it with Wifi adapter, which also failed. So ultimately I am Including instruction that are working for me with NAT network bridge on Windows 11. 

- Q. Why I Chose Windows 11
- A. Well its your choice you can follow same instruction with QEMU installed on the Ubuntu 22.04, well in my case I have access to 5GHz wifi in Windows, my Wifi Adapter didnt work in 6GHz mode. I tried installing driver from source code but it never picked up my 5GHz SSID.

# Setting Up ARM-based Ubuntu 18.04 for AWS Greengrass Core on Windows 11

In this guide, we'll walk through the steps to set up an ARM-based Ubuntu 18.04 virtual machine on Windows 11 using QEMU. We'll configure the VM for OpenSSH access and prepare it for experimenting with AWS Greengrass Core V2, including manual installation and fleet provisioning. Additionally, we'll cover how to clone the base VM for multiple instances.

**NOTE** You should have the Administrative privileges in your Windows 11 machine to perform following steps

     [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("Path", $env:Path, [System.EnvironmentVariableTarget]::Machine)
     ```

## Step 3: Download and Use `QEMU_EFI.fd`
 - **NOTE** Follow this step if you want to otherwise I have included this file in github 
  
1. **Download the OVMF Package**:
   - Visit the [Fedora Project's OVMF package page](https://www.kraxel.org/repos/jenkins/edk2/).
   - Download the appropriate `.rpm` package (e.g., `edk2-aarch64-<version>.rpm`).

2. **Extract `QEMU_EFI.fd`**:
   - Use `7-Zip` or another extraction tool to open the `.rpm` file.
   - Navigate to the `usr/share/edk2` or similar directory and extract `QEMU_EFI.fd`.

3. **Move `QEMU_EFI.fd` to Your QEMU Directory**:
   - Place the `QEMU_EFI.fd` file in a directory such as `D:\arm-ubuntu-qemu`.

## Step 4: Create the Ubuntu 18.04 ARM aarch64 Base Image

1. **Create a Base Image**:
   ```powershell
   qemu-img create -f qcow2 D:\arm-ubuntu-qemu\ubuntu-arm64.qcow2 20G
   ```

2. **Download Ubuntu 18.04 ARM64 ISO**:

### Kernel tuning for Greengrass Core V2 
   This step is required as specified in AWS documentation for [Lambda Function Requirement](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/greengrass/v2/developerguide/setting-up.html#greengrass-v2-lambda-requirements)

Please make sure of executing the following commands in your Guest VM shell answers all of `y` or `m` If thats the case you need not recompile kernel only you need to set grub configuration. 


```bash
grep CONFIG_IPC_NS /boot/config-$(uname -r)
grep CONFIG_UTS_NS /boot/config-$(uname -r)
grep CONFIG_USER_NS /boot/config-$(uname -r)
grep CONFIG_PID_NS /boot/config-$(uname -r)
grep CONFIG_CGROUP_DEVICE /boot/config-$(uname -r)
grep CONFIG_CGROUPS /boot/config-$(uname -r)
grep CONFIG_MEMCG /boot/config-$(uname -r)
grep CONFIG_POSIX_MQUEUE /boot/config-$(uname -r)
grep CONFIG_OVERLAY_FS /boot/config-$(uname -r)
grep CONFIG_HAVE_ARCH_SECCOMP_FILTER /boot/config-$(uname -r)
grep CONFIG_SECCOMP_FILTER /boot/config-$(uname -r)
grep CONFIG_KEYS /boot/config-$(uname -r)
grep CONFIG_SECCOMP /boot/config-$(uname -r)
grep CONFIG_SHMEM /boot/config-$(uname --r)
```
In my case the default kernel `4.15.0-213-generic` supports all these parameters, so I am skipping it to [Step 7: Configure GRUB for cgroup Settings](#step-7-configure-grub-for-cgroup-settings)
My output of Above commands
```bash
$ grep CONFIG_IPC_NS /boot/config-$(uname -r)
CONFIG_IPC_NS=y
$ grep CONFIG_UTS_NS /boot/config-$(uname -r)
CONFIG_UTS_NS=y
$ grep CONFIG_USER_NS /boot/config-$(uname -r)
CONFIG_USER_NS=y
$ grep CONFIG_PID_NS /boot/config-$(uname -r)
CONFIG_PID_NS=y
$ grep CONFIG_CGROUP_DEVICE /boot/config-$(uname -r)
CONFIG_CGROUP_DEVICE=y
$ grep CONFIG_CGROUPS /boot/config-$(uname -r)
CONFIG_CGROUPS=y
$ grep CONFIG_MEMCG /boot/config-$(uname -r)
CONFIG_MEMCG=y
CONFIG_MEMCG_SWAP=y
# CONFIG_MEMCG_SWAP_ENABLED is not set
$ grep CONFIG_POSIX_MQUEUE /boot/config-$(uname -r)
CONFIG_POSIX_MQUEUE=y
CONFIG_POSIX_MQUEUE_SYSCTL=y
$ grep CONFIG_OVERLAY_FS /boot/config-$(uname -r)
CONFIG_OVERLAY_FS=m
# CONFIG_OVERLAY_FS_REDIRECT_DIR is not set
CONFIG_OVERLAY_FS_REDIRECT_ALWAYS_FOLLOW=y
# CONFIG_OVERLAY_FS_INDEX is not set
$ grep CONFIG_HAVE_ARCH_SECCOMP_FILTER /boot/config-$(uname -r)
CONFIG_HAVE_ARCH_SECCOMP_FILTER=y
$ grep CONFIG_SECCOMP_FILTER /boot/config-$(uname -r)
CONFIG_SECCOMP_FILTER=y
$ grep CONFIG_KEYS /boot/config-$(uname -r)
CONFIG_KEYS=y
CONFIG_KEYS_COMPAT=y
$ grep CONFIG_SECCOMP /boot/config-$(uname -r)
CONFIG_SECCOMP_FILTER=y
CONFIG_SECCOMP=y
$ grep CONFIG_SHMEM /boot/config-$(uname --r)
CONFIG_SHMEM=y
```
You can download the kernel source directly from the Ubuntu repositories. This approach ensures you get the correct version of the kernel that matches your current installation. Here are the steps to download and compile the kernel from the Ubuntu repository:

To download the kernel source from the Ubuntu repositories, you need to enable the source code repositories in your `sources.list`. Here's how to do it:

### Step-by-Step Guide to Enable Source Repositories and Download Kernel Source
Let's take a different approach to enable the necessary kernel configurations. We can directly edit the `.config` file to set the required options. Here are the steps to do that:

### Step-by-Step Guide to Manually Edit the Kernel Configuration

#### Step 1: Download the Kernel Source Code

1. **Enable Source Repositories**:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list
   ```

   Uncomment the lines starting with `deb-src` for your distribution (e.g., `bionic` for Ubuntu 18.04). The lines should look similar to this:
   ```plaintext
   deb-src http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ bionic main restricted
   deb-src http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ bionic-updates main restricted
   deb-src http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ bionic universe
   deb-src http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ bionic-updates universe
   deb-src http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ bionic multiverse
   deb-src http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ bionic-updates multiverse
   deb-src http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ bionic-backports main restricted universe multiverse
   ```

2. **Update the package lists**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   ```

3. **Install the required tools**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install fakeroot build-essential ncurses-dev xz-utils libssl-dev bc flex libelf-dev bison
   ```

4. **Download the kernel source**:
   ```bash
   mkdir ~/kernelbuild
   cd ~/kernelbuild
   apt source linux-image-$(uname -r)
   ```

5. **Navigate to the kernel source directory**:
   ```bash
   cd linux-*
   ```

#### Step 2: Copy Current Kernel Configuration

Use the current kernel configuration as a starting point:

```bash
cp /boot/config-$(uname -r) .config
```

#### Step 3: Manually Edit the `.config` File

1. **Open the `.config` file for editing**:
   ```bash
   nano .config
   ```

2. **Add or modify the following lines to enable the required configurations**:

   - **Namespaces**:
     ```plaintext
     CONFIG_IPC_NS=y
     CONFIG_UTS_NS=y
     CONFIG_USER_NS=y
     CONFIG_PID_NS=y
     ```

   - **Cgroups**:
     ```plaintext
     CONFIG_CGROUP_DEVICE=y
     CONFIG_CGROUPS=y
     CONFIG_MEMCG=y
     ```

   - **Others**:
     ```plaintext
     CONFIG_POSIX_MQUEUE=y
     CONFIG_OVERLAY_FS=m
     CONFIG_HAVE_ARCH_SECCOMP_FILTER=y
     CONFIG_SECCOMP_FILTER=y
     CONFIG_KEYS=y
     CONFIG_SECCOMP=y
     CONFIG_SHMEM=y
     ```

  When CONFIG_OVERLAY_FS=m is set, it means that the Overlay filesystem support is built as a module. This module can be loaded and unloaded dynamically, rather than being built directly into the kernel.

3. **Save and close the file** (in nano, press `Ctrl + O` to save and `Ctrl + X` to exit).

#### Step 4: Compile and Install the Kernel

1. **Compile the kernel**:
   ```bash
   make -j$(nproc)
   ```

2. **Install the modules**:
   ```bash
   sudo make modules_install
   ```

3. **Install the kernel**:
   ```bash
   sudo make install
   ```

#### Step 5: Update Bootloader

1. **Update the initramfs and GRUB**:
   ```bash
   sudo update-initramfs -c -k $(make kernelrelease)
   sudo update-grub
   ```


- Load the Overlay Module:
After rebooting into the new kernel, you need to load the module. You can load it manually or ensure it is loaded at boot time
- To load at boot time:
Create a file in `/etc/modules-load.d/` to automatically load the overlay module at boot.
```bash
echo "overlay" | sudo tee /etc/modules-load.d/overlay.conf
```
2. **Reboot the system**:
   ```bash
   sudo reboot
   ```
#### Step 6: Verify the Configuration

After rebooting, verify that the new kernel options are enabled:

```bash
grep CONFIG_IPC_NS /boot/config-$(uname -r)
grep CONFIG_UTS_NS /boot/config-$(uname -r)
grep CONFIG_USER_NS /boot/config-$(uname -r)
grep CONFIG_PID_NS /boot/config-$(uname -r)
grep CONFIG_CGROUP_DEVICE /boot/config-$(uname -r)
grep CONFIG_CGROUPS /boot/config-$(uname -r)
grep CONFIG_MEMCG /boot/config-$(uname -r)
grep CONFIG_POSIX_MQUEUE /boot/config-$(uname -r)
grep CONFIG_OVERLAY_FS /boot/config-$(uname -r)
grep CONFIG_HAVE_ARCH_SECCOMP_FILTER /boot/config-$(uname -r)
grep CONFIG_SECCOMP_FILTER /boot/config-$(uname -r)
grep CONFIG_KEYS /boot/config-$(uname -r)
grep CONFIG_SECCOMP /boot/config-$(uname -r)
grep CONFIG_SHMEM /boot/config-$(uname --r)
```

Each command should return the configuration option with `=y` indicating it is enabled.

### Step 7: Configure GRUB for cgroup Settings

1. **Edit the GRUB configuration file**:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/default/grub
   ```

2. **Modify the `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT` line** to include the desired kernel parameters:
   ```plaintext
   GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash cgroup_enable=memory cgroup_memory=1 systemd.unified_cgroup_hierarchy=0"
   ```

3. **Save and close the file** (in nano, press `Ctrl + O` to save and `Ctrl + X` to exit).

4. **Update GRUB**:
   ```bash
   sudo update-grub
   ```

5. **Reboot the system**:
   ```bash
   sudo reboot
   ```

6. **Verify the kernel parameters**:
   ```bash
   cat /proc/cmdline
   ```

   You should see the parameters `cgroup_enable=memory`, `cgroup_memory=1`, and `systemd.unified_cgroup_hierarchy=0` in the output.

By following these steps, you can configure your system to enable memory cgroups, set the cgroup hierarchy to v1, and ensure that the required kernel parameters are enabled. This setup will allow you to support applications like AWS Greengrass Core V2 on your Ubuntu 18.04 aarch64 system.


## Step 7: Verify following commands else install them

- Your device must have the `mkfifo` shell command
  
  Its usually there in Ubuntu 18.04 aarch64
- check `useradd`, `groupadd` and `usermod` are working
  
  They are usually there in Ubuntu 18.04 aarch6
- Validate all the [Greengrass Core V2 requirements](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/greengrass/v2/developerguide/setting-up.html#greengrass-v2-requirements)

```

Explanation of Changes
- **Unique MAC Addresses**: Each instance has a unique MAC address to avoid network conflicts.
- **Different Port Forwarding**: Each instance uses a different port for SSH forwarding (e.g., 2222 for the first instance and 2223 for the second instance).
- **Snapshot Mode**: Using snapshot=on ensures that changes are not written to the base image, making it safer to run multiple instances concurrently.
